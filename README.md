# Hi, I'm Andreas 👋
### 🚀 Bridging the gap between High-End Hardware and Intelligent Software

I am an Information Electronics Technician turned Industrial Engineering student. I don't just write code; I build the interface where the digital world meets physical reality. Over the last years, I've deep-dived into UI/UX design, full-stack development, and hardware-level sensor integration. 

I am obsessed with execution speed and shipping products that solve real problems.

## 🛠️ What I've Shipped Recently (Builder's Log)

I believe in building in public and launching fast. Here is what I shipped recently:

* 🌍 **[Lumentario.com](https://lumentario.com) (Launched Feb 2026):** An AI-driven language learning platform that helps users learn Italian through real-world news. Built with advanced AI APIs and Supabase.
* 🛡️ **Lexia (Chrome Extension):** An automated scanning tool that analyzes websites for GDPR (DSGVO) compliance violations in real-time.
* 💀 **Skeletonizer (Chrome Extension):** A developer tool built to streamline web development workflows (UI/UX wireframing on the fly).
